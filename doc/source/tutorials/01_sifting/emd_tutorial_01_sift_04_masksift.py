Masked sifting
==============
This tutorial introduces some of the issues that standard EMD algorithms can
have with intermitent signals and shows how the Masked sift can resolve them.

# Lets make a simulated signal to get started.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

seconds = 5
sample_rate = 1024
time_vect = np.linspace(0, seconds, seconds*sample_rate)

# Create an amplitude modulation
am = np.sin(2*np.pi*time_vect)
am[am < 0] = 0

# Create a 25Hz signal and introduce the amplitude modulation
xx = am*np.sin(2*np.pi*25*time_vect)

# Create a non-modulated 6Hz signal
yy = .5*np.sin(2*np.pi*6*time_vect)

# Sum the 25Hz and 6Hz components together
xy = xx+yy

# Make a quick summary plot

# This signal doesn't contain any noise and only has two frequency components
# so should be straightforward to sift. Unfortunately, as the 25Hz signal
# component disappears completely for parts of the signal the EMD doesn't quite
# do what we'd want it to.
#
# Here we run a default sift and plot the IMFs.

imf = emd.sift.sift(xy, max_imfs=3)
emd.plotting.plot_imfs(imf, cmap=True, scale_y=True)

#%%
# The signals are well separated when both oscillations are present. However in
# time periods where the fast 25Hz signal disappears the slower signal jumps up
# to become part of the fast component. We'd prefer the separation into narrow
# band components as seen in the simulations above...
#
# This happens as EMD is a locally adaptive algorithm - the peaks and troughs
# in the signal define the time-scales that are analysed for a given part of
# the signal. So, the first IMF will always find the fastest peaks for every
# part of the signal even if the definition of 'fast' might be different in
# different segments.
#
# The Masked sift is a potential solution to this problem. This is a simple
# trick which effectively puts a lower bound on the frequency content that can
# enter a particular IMF. We will add a known masking signal to our time-series
# before running ``emd.sift.get_next_imf``. Any signals which are lower in
# frequency than this mask should then be ignored by the sift in favour of this
# known signal. Finally, we can remove the known mask to recover our IMF.
#
#Â Here we make a 30Hz mask and plot it next to a segment of our time-series.

mask = 0.1*np.sin(2*np.pi*30*time_vect)

plt.figure()
plt.plot(xy)
plt.plot(mask)
plt.xlim(0, 1000)

#%%
# We see that the masking signal is close in frequency to the fast burst but
# much faster than the 6Hz signal.
#
# Next we identify our next IMF on the raw signal with and without the mask

imf_raw, _ = emd.sift.get_next_imf(xy)
imf_mask, _ = emd.sift.get_next_imf(xy+mask)

#%%
# The normal IMF in the top panel has the problem we saw earlier, the slow
# signal is leaking into the fast IMF. The masked IMF successfully suppresses
# this slow signal, replacing it with the mask frequency. Finally, subtracting
# the mask removes everything but the 25Hz oscillation which now correctly
# disappears between bursts.

# This masking process is implemented in ``emd.sift.get_next_imf_mask`` which
# works much like ``emd.sift.get_next_imf`` with a couple of extra options for
# adding masks. We can specify the frequency and amplitude of the mask to be
# applied whilst isolating our IMF.
#
# It is important that the mask frequency is approximately equal to the signal
# component we want to isolate. If we use a mask of too high or too low
# frequency then the procedure will not work.
#
# Next we use a mask with an very high frequency which suppresses both signal components.

# Masks should be specified in normalised frequencies between 0 and .5 where 0.5 is half the sampling rate

#%%
# ``emd.sift.mask_sift`` uses ``emd.sift.get_next_imf_mask`` internally to run
# a whole set of sifts using the masking method. Each IMF is isolated with a
# separate mask which decreases in frequency for each successive IMF.
#
# Here we run a ``mask_sift`` using mask frequencies starting at 30Hz. This
# will reduce by one half for each successive IMF - the second mask will be
# 15Hz, the third is 7.5Hz and so on.

imf, mask_freqs = emd.sift.mask_sift(xy, mask_freqs=30/sample_rate, ret_mask_freq=True, max_imfs=4)

print(mask_freqs * sample_rate)

#%%
# We can see that this sift nicely separates the two components. The first IMF
# contains the 25Hz bursting signal which returns to a flat line between
# events. The second IMF contains very low amplitude noise. This is as the mask
# frequency of 15Hz for the second mask is still too high to isolate the
# oscillation of 6Hz - so IMF 2 is essentially flat. The third IMF with a mask
# frequency of 7.5Hz is about right to isolate the 6Hz signal.
