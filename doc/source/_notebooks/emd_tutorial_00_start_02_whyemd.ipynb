The most common\napproach is to use methods based on the Fourier-transform - in which we\nrepresent a signal with a set of sinusoidal basis functions. This is a very\npowerful and flexible approach but has some short-comings when working with\ndynamic or non-sinusoidal signals.\n\nLet's take a look at an example.
