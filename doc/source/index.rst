Features
========

* Sift algorithms including the ensemble sift, complete ensemble sift and mask sift
* Instantaneous phase, frequency and amplitude computation
* Cycle detection and analysis
* Hilbert-Huang spectrum estimation (1d frequency spectrum or 2d time-frequency spectrum)
* Second layer sift to quantify structure in amplitude modulations
* Holospectrum estimation (3d instantaneous frequency x amplitude modulation frequency x time spectrum)
